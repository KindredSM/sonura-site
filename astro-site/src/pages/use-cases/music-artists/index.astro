const faqs = [
  { question: 'Can I release music made with Sonura on Spotify?', answer: 'Yes! Full commercial rights on all tiers. Release on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, and every other platform. Keep 100% of your streaming royalties.' },
  { question: 'Do I need to credit Sonura?', answer: 'No. No attribution required. Release music as your own. No "produced by" credits needed for the AI-generated instrumental.' },
  { question: 'Is the quality good enough for professional releases?', answer: 'Yes. Sonura generates studio-quality instrumentals with proper mix balance. Many independent artists release tracks directly. For major releases, export stems and have your engineer polish the mix.' },
  { question: 'Can I sell beats I make with Sonura?', answer: 'Yes! Full commercial rights means you can sell beats on BeatStars, Airbit, or directly to other artists. You own the instrumental completely.' },
  { question: 'How does this compare to buying beats online?', answer: 'Buying beats means licensing someone else\'s work with splits and restrictions. Sonura gives you unique beats with full ownership. No leases, no exclusives, no royalty splits.' },
  { question: 'Can my engineer work with the stems?', answer: 'Absolutely. Export individual stems (drums, bass, melody, etc.) as WAV files and send to your mixing engineer. They get full control for a professional final mix.' },
  { question: 'What if I want to change the beat later?', answer: 'Generate variations instantly, or export stems and rearrange in your DAW. Add your own instruments, change the structure, or use just parts of the generation.' },
