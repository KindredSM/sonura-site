    <h2 id="what-are">What Are AI Music Generators?</h2>
    <p>AI music generators are tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to create original music from text prompts, existing audio, or other inputs. They've evolved from simple melody generators to sophisticated systems that can produce studio-quality, full-length tracks across any genre.</p>
    <p>In 2025, AI music generation technology has reached a point where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Output quality rivals human-made production</li>
      <li>Generation speed is under 10 seconds per track</li>
      <li>Style and genre control is highly precise</li>
      <li>Commercial use rights are clearly defined</li>
      <li>Integration with traditional DAWs is seamless</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="who-uses">Who Uses AI Music Generators?</h2>
    <h3>Music Producers</h3>
    <p>Producers use AI for breaking through creative blocks, generating initial ideas, creating reference tracks, or producing complete beats. Many integrate AI-generated loops and stems into their traditional DAW workflows.</p>
    <h3>Content Creators</h3>
    <p>YouTubers, podcasters, and video creators use AI music for royalty-free background music, intros, outros, and transitions. AI generation is faster and more customizable than searching through stock music libraries.</p>
    <h3>Independent Artists</h3>
    <p>Solo artists and bands use AI to create backing tracks, demo ideas, or full instrumentals for vocals. It's especially valuable for artists who can't afford studio time or session musicians.</p>
    <h3>Beginners & Hobbyists</h3>
    <p>People with no music theory knowledge can now create professional-sounding music. AI music generators democratize music production, making it accessible to everyone.</p>

  <section class="blog-section">
    <h2 id="key-features">Key Features to Look For</h2>
    <h3>1. Generation Quality</h3>
    <p>The most important factor. Listen to examples from each platform. Quality includes audio fidelity, musical coherence, genre accuracy, and mixing quality.</p>
    <h3>2. Generation Speed</h3>
    <p>Time is money. The best AI music generators produce tracks in 5-15 seconds. Slower generation kills creative flow.</p>
    <h3>3. Stem Export</h3>
    <p>Can you export individual tracks (drums, bass, melody, vocals)? Stem export is crucial for custom mixing and professional post-production.</p>
    <h3>4. Commercial Use Rights</h3>
    <p>Critical for professionals. Can you monetize on YouTube/Spotify? Sell beats? Do you own the copyright?</p>
