const faqs = [
  { question: 'Is Sonura better than Udio for beat making?', answer: 'Yes. Sonura is specifically optimized for beat production with faster generation, more consistent quality, and better understanding of production genres like trap, house, and hip hop.' },
  { question: 'Can I use both Udio and Sonura?', answer: 'Absolutely! Use Sonura for professional beats and instrumentals where you need consistency and speed. Use Udio for experimental full songs where artistic exploration matters more than reliability.' },
  { question: 'Why is Sonura more consistent than Udio?', answer: "Sonura's AI is trained specifically on production music and beats, leading to more predictable, usable outputs. Udio's broader artistic focus results in more experimental (but less consistent) results." },
  { question: 'Which has better stem export?', answer: "Both offer quality stem export. Sonura includes it on all tiers (even free), while Udio requires paid plans. For instrumentals, Sonura's stem separation is cleaner due to no vocal elements." },
  { question: 'Is Sonura cheaper than Udio?', answer: "Pricing is similar, but Sonura's faster generation means you get more music per dollar. Plus, commercial rights and stem export are included on all tiers." },
